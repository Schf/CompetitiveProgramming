# CP4 book 1, Exercise 2.2.1.2:

A testcase that could exploit the given weakness is any array of size N with
O(N) repetitions of one specific element. In this case, the partition will
always throw these elements to the right side of the pivot, making the "divide
and conquer" nature of quick sort disappear.

I can't think of a trivial fix, but with a modification to the algorithm you
could group elements equal to the pivot right next to it, and adjusting the
interval to be sorted accordingly.
