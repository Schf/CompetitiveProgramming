# CP4 book 1, Exercise 2.2.5.2:

If you keep a reference to the list's tail, you can push into the queue by
inserting the elements there (first updating the "next" pointer of the last list
node to the newly created node, and then the tail pointer), and pop from the
queue by removing the element pointed by the head (first storing the node
pointed by the "next" pointer of the node pointed by the head, then clearing the
node pointed by the head, then pointing the head to the stored node).

*One* resizable array isn't enough to implement a queue, as it only supports
O(1) time complexity insertion and removal from the same end.
