# CP4 book 1, Exercise 2.2.5.1:

C++ STL vector class already offers O(1) insertion and deletion at the end of
the vector with "push_back" and "pop_back". If you want it to be faster, and
know beforehand the approximate maximum amount of elements that will be held in
the structure at any one point, you can pre-allocate memory with the "reserve"
function.

A static array of sufficient size can be made to behave like a stack by keeping
an index that points to the last valid element in the "stack". Inserting an
element means assigning the array position pointed by the index to equal the
inserted element and increasding the index by 1, and popping an element can be
just with just decreasing the index by 1. This implementation has the advantage
of having O(1) "deletion" of stack elements (by just setting the index to the
value at the start of the deleted block). On the other hand, if a sufficient
size can't be determined at compile time, a stack can't be done with a static
array.

Linked lists and deques can be trivially made into stacks.
