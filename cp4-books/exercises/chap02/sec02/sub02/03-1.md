# CP4 book 1, Exercise 2.2.2.3

We want to minimize the theoretical worst case time complexity of Radix Sort
with 32 bit integers. Radix Sort's time complexity is $O(d * (n + k))$, where
$d$ is the number of digits of the largest number of the array, $n$ is the size
of the array, and $k$ is the base of the number. The naive implementation uses
base 10 which, for 32 bit integers, implies $d \approx 10$ and $k = 10$. To
minimize the number of operations, we have to choose $d$ and $k$ to minimize the
equation presented.

```math
\min_{d, k} d \cdot \left( n + k \right); \;
d = \log_k(2^32) = \frac{32}{\log_2(k)}
```

```math
\min_{d, k} d \cdot \left( n + k \right) =
32 \cdot \min_{k} \left(\frac{n}{\log_2(k)} + \frac{k}{\log_2(k)}\right)
```

For a sufficiently large $n$, the formula above is minimized by choosing a very
large $k$, making $d$ small. As an example, for $n = 10^5$ (as it commonly is is
these kinds of problems), the optimal $k$ is $k \approx 11924$. Since this base
is unwieldy and hard to represent, we could choose a power of two as a base. To
take advantage of the fact that we represent the numbers in 32 bits, a nice
choice of base is $2^16$, which would require only two counting sorts, each with
bucket of size 65536.
