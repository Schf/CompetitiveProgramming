# CP4 book 1, Exercise 2.2.5.3:

Use one array as the queue's "entrace" and one as it's "exit". Whenever you push
something into the queue, push it normally to the back of the entrance. When you
and to pop an element from the front, if the exit is empty, you first need to
make it equal to the reverse of the entrance array, then you clear the entrance
array, and then you pop the element you want from the back of the exit. If the
exit array isn't empty, simply pop from it's back.

This works in amortized O(1) time because any given element is only pushed and
popped from an array two times, once from the entrace and once from the exit.
