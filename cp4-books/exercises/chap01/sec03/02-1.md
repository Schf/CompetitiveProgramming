# CP4 book 1, Exercise 1.3.2.1: Problem types.

- Kattis wordcloud: Ad hoc, greedy.
- Kattis turbo: Ad hoc.
- UVa 10360: DP, graph.
- Kattis hindex: Ad hoc.
- UVa 11292: Greedy, (sort of) two pointer.
- UVa 11450: Don't know. Tried bitmask DP, got TLE.
- UVa 11512: Don't know. I think I could do it with Suffix Array construction
algorithm. Use the algorithm until all ranks are different, go to previous
iteration and find indexes where ranks were equal, use previous-previous
iteration to increment substring by half substring length, repeat until max
length with two or more equal suffixes.
- UVa 10065: 2D geometry.
- UVa 11506: Don't know. Obviously related to graphs, but I know nothing else.
- Kattis bilateral: Don't know. Something involving bipartite graphs?
